Here's a list of the Podman commands mentioned in our conversation, each with a brief description of its purpose:

1. **`podman search`**:
   - **Command**: `podman search docker.io/nginx`
   - **Description**: Searches for container images on Docker Hub or other registries. In this example, it's used to find images related to "nginx" on Docker Hub.

2. **`podman ps`**:
   - **Command**: `podman ps`
   - **Description**: Lists all currently running containers. Adding `-a` shows all containers, including stopped ones.

3. **`podman pull`**:
   - **Command**: `podman pull docker.io/nginx:latest`
   - **Description**: Pulls an image from a container registry. Here, it pulls the latest Nginx image from Docker Hub.

4. **`podman run`**:
   - **Commands**:
     - `podman run -d -p 80:80 docker.io/nginx:latest`
     - `podman run -d --name web8080 -p 8080:80 docker.io/nginx:latest`
   - **Description**: Starts a new container from a specified image. `-d` runs the container in detached mode (in the background), `-p` maps a port from the host to the container, and `--name` assigns a name to the container.

5. **`podman stop`**:
   - **Command**: `podman stop [CONTAINER ID or NAME]`
   - **Description**: Stops a running container. The container can be specified by its ID or name.

6. **`podman image save`**:
   - **Command**: `podman image save -o nginx_latest.tar docker.io/nginx:latest`
   - **Description**: Saves an image to a tar archive file, allowing it to be transferred and loaded on another system.

7. **`podman export`**:
   - **Command**: `podman export web8080 -o web8080.tar`
   - **Description**: Exports a container's filesystem to a tar file, useful for backups or analysis.

8. **`podman commit`**:
   - **Command**: `podman commit mynginxcontainer mynewnginximage`
   - **Description**: Creates a new image from a modified running or stopped container. This is useful for saving changes made within a container.
  
**To create a new container from an Image**
https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/
1. Clone the repository where the image is
2. Add a Dockerfile (touch Dockerfile)
3. Open the Dockerfile in a text editor and then a

# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM node:18-alpine.
WORKDIR /app.
COPY . .
RUN yarn install --production.
CMD ["node", "src/index.js"].
EXPOSE 3000.



Certainly! Here's a list of all the Podman commands I've mentioned in this conversation, along with a brief description for each:

1. **`podman build -t getting-started:0.0.1 .`**
   - **Description**: Builds a Docker-compatible container image from a Dockerfile in the current directory, tagging it as `getting-started:0.0.1`.

2. **`podman image inspect my-image:0.0.1`**
   - **Description**: Displays detailed information about the container image `my-image:0.0.1`, including its configuration, environment variables, and layers.

3. **`podman diff --from-image image1 --to-image image2`**
   - **Description**: Compares the file systems of two images, `image1` and `image2`, listing differences such as added, deleted, or modified files.

4. **`podman build -t myweb:0.0.1 .`**
   - **Description**: Builds a container image using the Dockerfile (or Containerfile) in the current directory and tags it as `myweb:0.0.1`.

5. **`podman login [your-private-repository]`**
   - **Description**: Authenticates with a private container registry, allowing you to push and pull images from this repository.

6. **`podman tag myweb:0.0.1 myrepo.com/myweb:0.0.1`**
   - **Description**: Tags an existing local image `myweb:0.0.1` with a new tag that includes the repository address, preparing it for pushing to that repository.

7. **`podman push myrepo.com/myweb:0.0.1`**
   - **Description**: Pushes the tagged image `myweb:0.0.1` to a specified private repository (`myrepo.com`).

Each of these commands is part of managing and interacting with container images using Podman, from building and inspecting images to tagging and pushing them to a repository.
